## Intro

After a lot of self-reflection, weekly therapy, and a year of distance from the industry, I'm ready to share my experience with burn-out.

This post is an exploration of the conditions that can lead to burn-out, personal habits and behaviors that contributed to my personal burn-out, and what I'm doing to get back to myself.

**This post is not a reflection on past employers.** I believe that these conditions can arise in even the healthiest of organizations. A healthy dose of grace for everyone involved is a requirement for reading.

## What is burn-out?

Lots as been written on burn-out. Burn-out is often characterized as emotional exhaustion, a shutdown and refusal to learn/take in new information. Burn-out was first written about scientifically [in 1974 by the psychologist Freudenberger](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1974.tb00706.x), summarized here:

> The dictionary defines the verb “burn-out” as “to fail, wear out, or become exhausted by making excessive demands on energy, strength, or resources.” And that is exactly what happens when a staff member in an alternative institution burns out for whatever reasons and becomes inoperative to all intents and purposes.

The author goes on to describe physical signs like fatigue, behavioral signs like quickness to anger, inflexibility (not traits that you want in a collaborative environment.)
