I've gone and done it again. A blog refresh. Starting from scratch. Why? It's my party, and I can refactor if I want to. In reality, it boils down to a few reasons!

## A Return to Simplicity

The web has trended towards over-engineered solutions. I'm far from [alone](http://localhost:8080/blog/firstpost/#good-ole-html) in this opinion!

### Platform

The last iteration of my site served as a way to familiarize myself with [Sanity CMS](https://sanity.io), a wonderful CMS platform for many applications. But in my case, it was overkill! I'm a singular person, without a content team or the need for complex content management approachs.

### Framework fatigue

I wanted to return to my roots and shed the over-engineered JS frameworks. All of it feels overkill for my personal site's needs:

- My content isn't very dynamic
- My content is very light-weight: text and photos
- I'm comfortable using Markdown

A static generator is perfect for a site that receives updates once a month!

## Community

The webdev community is beloved to me, and the only reason I have a career in web development. I am not self-taught, I am community-raised. And let me tell you, my community loves Eleventy.

## Features

### Sweet, sweet syntax highlighting

Being a developer, syntax highlighting on my blog is important to me! My prior Sanity CMS setup had an implementation, but I had to set up each language as one-offs. This was often the final roadblock between me authoring a post or not.

That's all possible through the [`eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight`](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/) plugin implementing [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com)!

### RSS Everywhere

It's truly making a comeback, at least in my life (blog to come!) And you guessed it, there's an official [an RSS plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/) ready to go.

### And More to Come

I've barely scratched the surface of the 11ty community (and my own journey in blogging.)

I hope this lowers the barrier of entry to writing posts. I'm excited to learn in public and give back to the community that has helped me for many years.
